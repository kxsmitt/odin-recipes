        Welcome to my recipe site! Here I will be working on learning HTML and CSS, and eventually Javascript. My goal with this site to continue to grow my web development skills and display them in a practical manner. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus far, we have learned about basical HTML elements, styling those elements with CSS. I have updated this site with some CSS attributes. I have also been working with boxes and styling them appropriately.
