The Odin Project RECIPES PROJECT

BEFORE THE PROJECT: 
It appears that this project will include using HTML to build a main index page that will contain links to recipes. Apparently it won't look to pretty, but we're still learning here so it's okay!

AFTER THE PROJECT:
Okay, so I failed to correctly edit the Pages setting as outlined in the directions under "Viewing your project on the web" section. Prior to deleting my previous repository with a ton of commits, I failed to view my webpage. I did save all of my code locally, so I did not have to redo it all. I am glad I understand where I went wrong, but I wish I understood before I deleted the repository.
